### 2.1.2 Debouncing the SPST

#### Add resistor and capacitor low-pass filter between the switch and the Teensy

**Notes**

- Make sure you have a large enough RC time constant so that you donâ€™t see multiple bounces on a single press (i.e., 100Hz bounces)
- Not too large that you distort button presses that occur at roughly 10 times per second (faster than most humans can press). 

#### Verify RC Circuit

- Use the output of a square wave from a function generator into the RC circuit and view the output on an oscilloscope or your OscilloSorta. 
- Notice how the signal changes as the frequency goes from below 10Hz to above 100Hz.
- Submit OscilloSorta images for each case. Ideally two traces:
    - one with output of input signal square wave 
    - one with filtered output 
- Show your calculation for the cutoff frequency of your low pass filter.

#### Input Capture

Use the input capture function of the timer on the Atmega32U4 to measure how fast you can depress a switch

**Note: ** make sure that the switch is debounced, so you only get valid presses. 

#### Human Reaction Speed

Change the code so that it:
1. prompts the person when to start
1. measures 5 presses 
1. prints out the average time between the 5 presses in milliseconds

**Leaderboard**

| Tries | Fastest Time |
| ----- | ------------ |

### Extra Credit: Improve Granularity

Determine and implement the finest time resolution that you can measure these time presses using input capture 3 assuming the slowest a person will be is 0.5 seconds.
