## 3.1 Waldo Input

### 3.1.1 Build Plan and Fabrication

**Dims of dog for input**

| | |
|-|-|
| Length | 8 inches |
| Width | 6.5 inches |
| Potentiometer - fixed part | Radius: 0.125 inches |
| Potentiometer - rotating | Radius:  0.062 inches|
| | |

**Notes from check-off with Walter 2/19**

- TODOs:
  - Figure out potentiometer mounting for paw and face
  - Create a U-shaped bracket which mounts near the pug's tail to hold the front and back piece together
  - Create assembly to make sure everything fits together well, and has the rotational degree of freedom
- Potentiometer stem might be too short to go all the way through the body and connect with the face or the paw
- Since the servos we have to use for the actuation part of the assignment are quite tiny, may need to shrink the design for that part
    - Conduct a test

**Electrical Components**
