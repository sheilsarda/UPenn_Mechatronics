## Lab 0 - COVID Edition

### 1. Multimeters

##### 0.1.1 What happens if you use the wrong two plugs to measure something? â€‹

- Multimeter can explode because of a short-circuit
- Measurement can be incorrect and meaningless

##### 0.1.2 What types of readings can your multimeter measure? 

- DC Voltage
	- 200mV to 600V
	- 0.5% Accuracy
- DC Current
	- 2mA to 10A
	- 1-3% Accuracy
- AC Voltage
	- 200V to 600V
	- 1.2% Accuracy
- Resistance
	- 200Ohms to 2MegaOhms
	- 0.8% Accuracy

##### 0.1.3 Find a battery and measure the voltage across the battery. 

**Is this what you would expect?**

**Does it match the voltage stated on the battery? If not, why?**

##### 0.1.4 Connectivity test 

2 things that are connected:

- Jumper cable 
- Same end of the battery


### 2. Power Supply

No questions for submission.

### 3. Resistors

#### 0.3.1 Use the DMM to measure a variety of resistors from your kit. 

- Combine two different resistors in parallel, and take a separate measurement of two in series. Are the readings within tolerances? 
- Try holding the resistor to the probes with your fingers touching the metal? 
- How does the resistor change if you make the connection to the resistor without touching it? 
- If the readings are different, why?

#### 0.3.2 Connect the two resistors that are larger than 1Kohm in series on the protoboard

- Attach one end of the two to 5V of the battery and the other end to ground. 
- Measure the voltage at the three points of the two resistors (each end and the middle). 
- What is the voltage? 
- How does this match expectation as a voltage divider? 
- What would the current be going through either resistor?
