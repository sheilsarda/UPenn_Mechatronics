	- 0.8% Accuracy

##### 0.1.3 Find a battery and measure the voltage across the battery. 

**Is this what you would expect?**

**Does it match the voltage stated on the battery? If not, why?**

##### 0.1.4 Connectivity test 

2 things that are connected:

- Jumper cable 
- Same end of the battery
