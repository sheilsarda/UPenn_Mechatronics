#### Research different types of mobile bases:

If you choose to use different motors, be careful about the power
capability of the battery and the limits of the motor drivers.

1. Have a completed draft CAD assembly of your car ready to be reviewed
by teaching staff in lecture on Monday 3/15. 
1. Be ready to create and submit `.dwg` files if your
TA/coach approves your design. 
1. Drafts should be near complete so the TA’s can judge how
they assemble. 
1. Be sure to follow the laser-cutting guidelines (reproduced below for your
convenience). 
1. ​Submit drafts to canvas.
