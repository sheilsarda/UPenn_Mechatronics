## Functionality

    - A high level description of your approach to winning the game with an explanation of the design choices you made.
    - Describe minimal functionality approach
    - Describe extra components
    - Describe performance what worked/what didnâ€™t and why
    - Include one nice photo and BOM in Appendix

## Mechanical Design

    - Describe intended approach and actual performance
    - Include things that you tried but failed (and thus learned from)
    - Include measured drawings (e.g. CAD) in appendix

## Electrical Design

    - Describe intended approach and actual performance
    - Include things that you tried but failed (and thus learned from)
    - Include schematics in appendix.

## Processor architecture and code architecture

    - Include a block diagram of how MCU's are logically connected
    - Describe software approach
    - Include things that you tried but failed (and thus learned from)

## Retrospective (non-graded)
    - What you feel was most important that you learned
    - What was the best parts of the class
    - What you had the most trouble with
    - What you wish was improved
    - Anything else about class.

## Appendix

    - BOM (Bill of Materials), which list the items and quantities used to construct your robot and controller.
    - Schematics of all electronic circuits
    - Nice photo or rendering of full robot
    - CAD drawings (or mechanical drawings) highlighting anything special
    - All data sheets for all components that are not parts supplied by the ministore (either links or copies of data sheets)
    - Upload all code to canvas (separately)
    - Include links to videos of functionality
    - Optional if you have fun competition video links please add.
