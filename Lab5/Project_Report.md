## Functionality

### Strategy for the Game (Minimal Functionality)

#### Can Grabbing

My approach to can grabbing evolved over the course of the competition from using gripper arms to pushing cans and beacons.

**Gripper Arms**:

    - Design approved prior for manufacturing used 2 servo motors with arms to lock in the can 
    - Main challenge with this design was that servo arms did not have enough torque to keep the can locked during movement
    - Also the servo horn did not stay locked on to the servo even with the aid of hot glue

**Pushing**:

    - With holonomic drive the robot can easily navigate around the beacon and push it into the doubling zone
    - Only drawback with this approach is the robot cannot pull in cans or beacons that are located near the edge of the map because it doesn't have the space to nudge itself between the wall and can 
    - Lost a few matches because robot pushed the beacon into the wall and was unable to move it closer to the center
    - Partnership with Rafael for the playoff games allowed me to focus on just pushing the beacon into the doubling zone and then venture out in the opposing side to get time points, so did not have to worry about getting cans from the periphery of the map since his nimble robot was able to fetch all the cans

#### Autonomous Modes

    - Left, Right and Front sensor ranging data was available on my dashboard to indicate where obstacles were
    - Could leverage wall-following behavior to drive myself to the opposite side of the map and wait there to gain points

    - Upload all code to canvas (separately)
    - Include links to videos of functionality
    - Optional if you have fun competition video links please add.
